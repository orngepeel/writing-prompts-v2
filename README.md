# Overview
Sometimes the hardest part of writing is deciding what to write. This is a random writing prompt generator that selects a genre, protagonist description, and a conflict for you, so you can get right to the good stuff!

Prompt elements are stored in a MongoDB cluster.

- Write a Horror story where a barista from Manhattan confides in several moons.
- Write a Coming of Age story where a barista from Manhattan fights against state lines.

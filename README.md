Note: The database is hosted on Heroku, so sometimes it takes a few extra seconds on the first prompt!

# Overview
Sometimes the hardest part of writing is deciding what to write. This is a random writing prompt generator that selects a genre, protagonist description, and a conflict for you, so you can get right to the good stuff!

# Additional Information
This is an improved version of an older project of mine. This version is more dynamic and has more ability to scale than the original. I have left the original version live to demonstrate growth and improvement. Note that both versions contain the same styling. The original version can be accessed [here](https://github.com/orngepeel/writing-prompt-generator).

# Example Prompts

- Write a Surreal story where an assassin who is very good at her job struggles with someone quirky.
- Write a Horror story where a barista from Manhattan confides in several moons.
- Write a Coming of Age story where a barista from Manhattan fights against state lines.
